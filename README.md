# GenerativeAI Tutorial

This tutorial series on Generative AI using LangChain showcases practical implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, hybrid search techniques, and evaluation methods. It walks you through building real-world applications using OpenAI, HuggingFace, and LangSmith, with a focus on making Generative AI systems more powerful, interpretable, and efficient.

Whether you're a beginner exploring LangChain or an advanced practitioner building scalable GenAI applications, this tutorial-style project provides modular examples and hands-on guidance to help you master Generative AI development.
